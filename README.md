# ðŸ“Š Study on Properties and Statistical Inference of NDNPED

This repository contains all relevant materials for my M.Sc. Statistics final-year project titled:

> **"Study on Properties and Statistical Inference of Natural Discrete New Polynomial Exponential Distribution (NDNPED)"**

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

The project introduces and investigates a new discrete probability distribution: **NDNPED**. It focuses on:

- Deriving mathematical properties such as mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis, median, mode, etc.
- Studying parameter estimation using **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)**.
- Comparing NDNPED with other well-known discrete distributions.
- Real data application and goodness-of-fit comparisons.
